## SWOT analysis
## EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS

The external system is to assume full responsibility for storage functions as well as warehouse management and warehouse control for an entire warehouse. The interfaces in this section are specified by documenting: the name and description of each scheme, source or input, destination or output, ranges, accuracy and tolerances, units of measure, timing, display formats, and organization, and data formats.

The user interface required to be developed for the system should be

user-friendly and attractive. The interface between the user and the system will be WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointers) keeping in mind that the system is to be run through a web browser. All operations will be off point and click nature with all navigations performed through windows of the system specifically buttons and menus:

Buttons: The button is activated when the user will click on the left click of the mouse within the bounds of the button. And thus the action associated with it will be carried out.

## Identifying features
Application the work of the waiter is reduced and we can also say that the work is nullified. 
The benefit of this is that if there is a rush in the Canteen then there will be
chances that the waiters will be unavailable and the users can directly order the 
food to the chef online by using this application. The user will have a username and a 
password, by using which they can login into the system. 
This implies that the customer is the regular user of the Canteen.
